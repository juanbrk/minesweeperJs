# MineSweeperJS

This is a classic version of minesweeper created with create-react-app. You can select between 3 pre-defined levels. In order to
win you should flag over all tiles that you think contain mine, to do this simple right click over a tile or - if mobile - hold 
a tile. To reveal tiles that you think dont contain mines, simple click over it or tap on it. Once finished you can opt to save your progress.
You can also check how you did on previous games on the Finished games section. 
Board setup and Game Setup pages are still under construction. 

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo and run npm start on your CLI and the project will run at your browser's localhost:3000 port
