# MineSweeperJS

This is a classic version of minesweeper created with create-react-app. You can select between 3 pre-defined levels. In order to
win you should flag over all tiles that you think contain mine, to do this simple right click over a tile or - if mobile - hold 
a tile. To reveal tiles that you think dont contain mines, simple click over it or tap on it. Once finished you can opt to save your progress.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo and run npm start on your CLI and the project will run at your browser's localhost:3000 port 
or you can also access https://react-minesweeper-b33e6.firebaseapp.com/ to see it running online.
